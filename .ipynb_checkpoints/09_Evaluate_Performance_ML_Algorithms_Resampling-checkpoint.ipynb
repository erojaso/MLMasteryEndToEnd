    "# Evaluate the Performance of Machine Learning Algorithms with Resampling\n",
    "\n",
    "You need to know how well your algorithms perform on unseen data. <a>The best way to evaluate the performance of an algorithm would be to make predictions for new data to which you already know the answers</a>. The second best way is to use <b>clever techniques from statistics called resampling</b> methods that allow you to make accurate estimates for how well your algorithm will perform on new data. In this chapter you will discover how you can estimate the accuracy of your machine learning algorithms using resampling methods in Python and scikit-learn on the dataset. Let's get started.\n",

    "Why can't you train your machine learning algorithm on your dataset and use predictions from this same dataset to evaluate machine learning algorithms? The <a>simple answer is overfitting</a>.\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine an algorithm that remembers every observation it is shown during training. If you evaluated your machine learning algorithm on the same dataset used to train the algorithm, then an algorithm like this would have a perfect score on the training dataset. But the predictions it made on new data would be terrible. We must evaluate our machine learning algorithms on data that is not used to train the algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "The evaluation is an estimate that we can use to talk about how well we think the algorithm may actually do in practice. It is not a guarantee of performance. Once we estimate the performance of our algorithm, we can then re-train the final algorithm on the entire training dataset and get it ready for operational use. Next up we are going to look at four different techniques that we can use to split up our training dataset and create useful estimates of performance for our machine learning algorithms:\n",

    "## 9.2 Split into Train and Test Sets\n",
    "\n",
    "The simplest method that we can use to evaluate the performance of a machine learning algorithm is to use different training and testing datasets. We can take our original dataset and split it into two parts. Train the algorithm on the first part, make predictions on the second part and evaluate the predictions against the expected results. The size of the split can depend on the size and specifics of your dataset, although it is common to use 67% of the data for training and the remaining 33% for testing.\n",
    "\n",
    "This algorithm evaluation technique is very fast. <a>It is ideal for large datasets (millions of records) where there is strong evidence that both splits of the data are representative of the underlying problem</a>. Because of the speed, it is useful to use this approach when the algorithm you are investigating is slow to train. <b>A <a>downside</a> of this technique is that it can have a high variance</b>. This means that differences in the training and test dataset can result in meaningful differences in the estimate of accuracy. \n",
